    "Europe is the continent where people get awstruck by its natural beauty, epic history and dazzling artistic & culinary diversity. Europe's cultural heritage is its biggest single draw: the birthplace of democracy in Athens, the renaissance art of Florence, the graceful canal of Venice and lot more. Despite its population density Europe maintains spectacular natural scenary. Cheers! Salud! Prost! Europe has some best nightlife in the world. Globally famous DJs keep the party going in London, Berlin and Paris, all of which also offer top-class entertainment, especially theatre and live music. After one has ticked off the great museums, panaromic vistas and energetic nightlife comes the fun part, that people like me would enjoy, the magnificient menus: the pizza in Naples, souvlaki in Santorini or even haggis in Scotland. Europe's diversity and global reach is its trump card.\n",

    "<h4>1.2 Problem desciption</h4>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The rich diversity and magnificient history of Europe have always facinated me to live there. And I beleive there are lot of people like me out somewhere trying to find out a place, rather I would say a city, to live in Europe. This problem is designed to address these type of people. The problem is to cluster 500 cities in Europe on basis art, food and heritage. And then examine each cluster to find out which group/cluster offers most diverse characteristics so that we could select a city from that cluster as potential place to live in Europe. "

The rest of the five clusters are well enough. Cluster 1 (red) and Cluster 3 (blue) are formed mainly by the cities situated in Spain and United Kindom respectively. The most common place in Cluster 3  is a pub or a bar and in Cluster 1 it is a spanish restaurant. The cafes and restaurants offering various cuisines are popular among cities in Cluster 7 (orange). In Cluster 2 (purple) most of the cities belong from Russia and Ukraine. Cafes, parks, restautants and gyms are common places in cities of Cluster 2. Interestingly, Cluster 6 (yellow) is the most diverse among all: parks, theaters, historic sites, restautants, art museums and lot more to offer. Sample data from all the clusters are given below.

    "From the obtained results we observed following inferences. The light blue and the light green, the cities of Kalininskiy, Russia and Arad, Romania have formed separate clusters of themselves. But somehow, they both are similar to each other based on the features from 4th most common venue to 10th most common venue. These features are same for the two clusters Cluster 4 and 5. Next, the Cluster 1 (red markers) is comprising of cities msotly situated in Spain and spanish restaurants are famous venues in these cities. Along with spanish restaurants, parks, art museums, plaza are aslo popular. The blue markers belong to Cluster 3.In this cluster most cities are from the United Kingdom. Pubs, bar, coffee shops, parks are most common venues in these cities. Surprisingly Birmingham has indian restaurants as the third most common venue knowing the fact that India is in separate continent. So there must be a considerable population who love indian food. The orange markers denote cities belonging to Cluster 7, people living in these cities have nack for good food. Restaurants of varius cuisines: italian, japanese, meditarranean etc., cafes, parks, gyms are some of the most common places in the cities of Cluster 7. Cluster 2 (purple markers) consists of the European cities where the most common place is a coffee shop. Now comes my favorite cluster, Cluster 6 (yellow markers). Cities like Moscow, London, Berlin, Rome, Paris and many other popular cities that people often come across are in Cluster 6. The cities of Cluster 6 are culturally and socially diverse. Historic sites, restaurants, museums, scenic lookout, yoga studio, opera house are some of the most common sites in these cities."
